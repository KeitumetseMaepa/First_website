    <p>What is HTML you ask? HyperText Markup Language (HTML) is the set of markup symbols or codes inserted into a file intended for display on the Internet. As I would call it the blueprint to coding</p>

    <p>JavaScript is a text-based programming language used both on the client-side and server-side that allows you to make web pages interactive.JavaScript gives web pages interactive elements that engage a user.Examples of interactive elements include:hover, click, etc.Most of the functions and applications that make the Internet indispensable to modern life are coded in some form of JavaScript.</p>

      <font color="#1a3596"><h2>Benefits of JavaScript</h2></font>
        <ul id="Html list">
          <li>Speed. Client-side JavaScript is very fast because it can be run immediately within the client-side browser. Unless outside resources are required, JavaScript is unhindered by network calls to a backend server.</li>
          <li>Simplicity. JavaScript is relatively simple to learn and implement.</li>
          <li>Popularity. JavaScript is used everywhere on the web.</li>
          <li>Interoperability. JavaScript plays nicely with other languages and can be used in a huge variety of applications.</li>

      <font color="#1a3596"><h1>Why use CSS?</h1></font>

      <P>CSS is used for defining the styles for web pages. It describes the look and formatting of a document which is written in a markup language. It provides an additional feature to HTML. It is generally used with HTML to change the style of web pages and user interfaces.Using CSS, you can control the color of the text, the style of fonts, the spacing between paragraphs, how columns are sized and laid out, etc. The following are the advantages of CSS − CSS saves time − You can write CSS once and then reuse the same sheet in multiple HTML pages.In simpler terms CSS is the paint brush and HTML is the canvas.CSS makes your webpage visually appealing to the clients and people that come across it.</p>
