My name is Keitumetse Maepa.I attend Uitsig Highschool and is part of the RCL Exco committe and play for the girls hockey 1st team at my Highschool.I chose to design a website that is not only visually appealing, but that highlights my journey with Vodacom #CodeLikeAGirl. What better way to do so than by creating a website.Filled with all the new tricks and traits I've learnt throughout this journey.Hope you enjoy!</p>

<font color="#1a3596"><h2>About</h2></font>

<p> The main focus of my website is to highlight the effects of the different coding programs and the impact they have on the success and outcome of your website. These programs/Apps incluse JavaScript, html, atom, etc.For those of you that are unfamiliar withe the word "code","source code", this is just a collection of computer instructions written using some language that is readable to humans.The purpose of coding is to manipukate data; which is the storage of information on your computer.</p>
